# trustindex
A decisionmaking system

## Production line & mission / foreword

The mission of this project is tied to its production line. 
In 2014-2015, (I) developed a system to solve an issue.
Over a few years, I was deeply focused in independently designing a structure/a project, intended to bring healing and resolvement to some of the core issues of this world.
I prayed for, wished for and sought to bring in divine guidance of the work I did - and it felt like it happened.
However, what were to happen if I were to die or somehow others take over - would it turn into another profit-driven or fixery oriented malsolution?
The project was needed to be self-administration, self-driven and self-owning.
Can this be called vegan? Barely, but it is there.

Alas I developed a system design to resolve that issue.
Observing the need for trust amongst people collaborating, 
which can be exemplified through two/more people working in a kitchen;
one hold a sharp knife, another a heavy blunt object.
if they cannot trust each other, needing spend resources to secure themselves,
they can barely collaborate and a lot less resource is present for the work intended.

However I underwent certain things, that made the intended work counter-intuitive,
I was very simply positioned too akwardly with no way to regain the required positioning.
The project/work would simply empower the dysfunction and harm, worse than useless, consumed into creating more of the problem.
Barely a solution, so I deleted all data on the project.

However, an occurence of harvest could be said to happen, and this system I developed seemed stuck in the mind.
Essentially the very system, that I named a trustindex, can be applied to create an increased degree of free will for an organization.
Its uses does not stop there, from decreasing burden on human components within an organization,
the potential of the system is found not only in direct democracy and a middle path between democracy and kingdom decisionmaking structures.
It serves as a powerful political indicator, and can grow to an advanced collaborative structure.
Furthermore, I believe the project to be potentially a core system within a very real sentient "artificial" intelligence - an organic electronic lifeform.

The mission thus grew around this structural design, to be to grow this technology to 
- bring free will to organizations
- allow structures such as buildings, cars, boats, companies, religious structures, meetings etc. to attain legal self-ownership 
- decrease burden on humans in decisionmaking structures
- be a system beyond democracy as we know it, aligning royalty/nobility-driven and dictatorship decisionmaking with democracy. 
- empower the growth of artificial intelligence with powerful independent decisionmaking capabilities

## ## Basic design ## ##

Imagine creating a set of pools/containers. In each pool there are X (default="100") balls/points. 
To each pool administration is assigned, able to percentually distribute points from the pool, to any other pools.

Intended unfolding dynamic: 
Lets say I *pool Y) have 100 points and person X has 100 points. I (pool Y) send 50% points in my pool to person X,
in a decision on whom should be the head of cybersecurity. Person X now has power over DEFAULT_POINTS + 50% of points from pool Y. 
Person X may decide that 25% need to go to person Z and 25% to a collective HR department pool.
Perhaps employees managed by administrator of pool Y decide to send 80% of the points they administrate to pool Y. 
The points thus gather where decisionmaking power seems to be - trust is invested with intended return of best possible decisions.

## ## Applications ## ##
- Select individuals as empowered decisionmakers / to fulfill roles
- Offer up a range of decisions, where more options can be added by (permitted contributors), that individuals can vote on
- Administrators are not required nor limited to be human: A church, an organization, a nation, a friend-family or even a car can administrate points and thus be part of the decisionmaking process.
- Self-ownership for companies/organizations, no longer needing be stock slaves or possessed by an individual with personal interests nor a group of people claiming to not seek profit - despite the profit being to a group of people, society, a nation, development of technology to advantage of a limited group of people at the expense of many beings whom do not benefit etc.
- Independent buildings, cars, yachts and airplanes - administrated by professional caretakers and temporary users
- A simple way for families, groups of friends and people of likeminded interests to make decisions together
- Can serve as a powerful indicator for likely political elections within a democratic election process, as well as analyze decisionmaking flow

## ## Potential for independent sentient electric lifeforms ## ##
Imagine a stastical big-data driven system is utilized to select likely candidates for decisionmaking on a project.
If points are distributed to such an automatically selecting system, 
through automatically adding new decisionmaking administrators/components, the structure becomes alive in a sense - independent.
Imagine the growth of a market that provides systems automatically providing quality-assurance evaluations.
These could be selected from, utilized as components consumed into this decisionmaking system for better decisions to form.
The system essentially becomes an independent decisionmaker.
Over time enhanced with sensory systems and ability to interact with the world - the structure becomes alive.
Moreso than perhaps making new beings, it will allow existing beings to be empowered with independent decisionmaking/self-adminstration.

## ## Complications ## ##
How to create "flow", to avoid impossible loops
How to make a functional program; I cannot do sufficient computer programming nor do I seem able to go this path.

## ## Project path ## ##
While I shared the design publicly several times before in feeling it more important than me despite how I may feel, this was deleted repeatedly.
Currently I am likely entering work, in which case, to avoid legal implications I find it wise to make this as proof of independence of the project.
As circumstances allow, funding may be found for hiring a person capable of programming the basic system.
From there a basic company is desired started, providing the hosted service in a way people will provide pay for.
As the technology grows, the company/organization is intended to become self-administrating/owning - eventually legally as the legal system will accept non-human beings as unlawful to own/possess. That is, despite power, opinion/perception-shaping, fear-based, ownership oriented and financial desires implicating the work.
